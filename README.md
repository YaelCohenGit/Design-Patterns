# Design-Patterns
The system that simulates Source Control activity (such as Git), allows the storage of branches, files, folders. Throughout the development of the software, a file can be in different states and no necessary steps are skipped. A history of the actions performed on the file is shown to the user at his request and a file can be restored to its previous state. When a review request is received, the parties who can approve the file are automatically notified.
